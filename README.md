## URL Shortener

URL Shortener is my first official webapp running on node.js. This is definitely in development and primarily a test best to learn Node.js, MongoDB, Pug, and everything else the express generator has.

### Setup

If for what ever reason you would like to actually run this you will need to configure a MongoDB Database with a urls and count collection.
